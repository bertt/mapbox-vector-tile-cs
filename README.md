# mapbox-vector-tile-cs 

[![NuGet Status](http://img.shields.io/nuget/v/mapbox-vector-tile.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/mapbox-vector-tile/) ![.NET 8](https://github.com/bertt/mapbox-vector-tile-cs/workflows/.NET%208/badge.svg)

.NET Standard 2.0 library for decoding a Mapbox vector tile. 

## Dependencies

- protobuf-net https://github.com/protobuf-net/protobuf-net

## Installation

```
$ Install-Package mapbox-vector-tile
```

## Usage

```cs
const string vtfile = "vectortile.pbf";
var stream = File.OpenRead(vtfile);
var layerInfos = VectorTileParser.Parse(stream);
```

Tip: If you use this library with vector tiles loading from a webserver, you could run into the following exception: 
'ProtoBuf.ProtoException: Invalid wire-type; this usually means you have over-written a file without truncating or setting the length'
Probably you need to check the GZip compression, see also TileParserTests.cs for an example.

## Building

```
$ git clone https://github.com/bertt/mapbox-vector-tile-cs.git
$ cd mapbox-vector-tile-cs
$ dotnet build
```

## Testing

```
$ git clone https://github.com/bertt/mapbox-vector-tile-cs.git
$ cd mapbox-vector-tile-cs/tests/mapbox.vector.tile.tests
$ dotnet test
Passed!
Failed: 0, Passed: 38, Skipped: 0, Total: 38, Duration: 937 ms

## Samples

1] GeoJSON

The samples folder contains a simple console application that reads a vector tile from a file and writes the GeoJSON to the console.

2] SkiaSharp Forms Sample

SkiaSharp is a cross-platform 2D graphics API for .NET platforms based on Google's Skia Graphics Library. The samples folder contains a simple GUI application that reads a 
vector tile from a file and draws the geometries using SkiaSharp.

## Benchmarking

Test performed with Mapbox vector tile '14-8801-5371.vector.pbf'

Layers used:

Point layer: parks (id=17) - 558 features

Line layer: roads (id=8) - 686 features

Polygon layer: building (id=5) - 975 features

```
